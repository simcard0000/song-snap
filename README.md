This project is made in VSCode. [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) was used to make the website. The [Microsoft Azure Computer Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/)
service and the [MusicBrainz XML Web Service](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/XML_Web_Service/Version_2) were accessed. This is one of my first sites; so the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) have been very helpful, particularly this article on 
[using files from web applications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/Using_files_from_web_applications#Selecting_files_using_drag_and_drop).
